# Portfolio

This is my protfolio project to house and display links to some of my projects that I will develop over my career. Responsive layout was used, devloping for mobile first and symantic elements were used for best practices compliance. the vast majority of code used was made from scratch, with some code taken from our advanced CSS lessons and adapted for use in this project.
